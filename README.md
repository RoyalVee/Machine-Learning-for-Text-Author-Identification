# Machine Learning Model for Text Author Identification
This ML model is developed for author identification for a given text documents

# Objective
This model can be used to predict the author of a given email based on the data set used to train the model.

# USE guide
- pass the name of the text words file and authors file into the preprocess function. Note; the files should be of PKL extension 
- the preprocess function processes the given data sets and returns the train and test data for the model
- The ML model is then trained on the given data

# Application
- Call clf.predict(features). Ensure to pass in the feature to predict as the argument and the return will be prediction for the given feature based on the data set provided.

# Contribution 
This model development is open to all contribution aimed at optimizing the model.
